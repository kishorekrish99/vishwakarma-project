Project Description:

AgriTech is an innovative web-based application designed to streamline the agricultural supply chain by establishing a direct connection between farmers and consumers. By eliminating middlemen and facilitating direct transactions, Farm2Home empowers farmers to sell their produce directly to consumers, thereby increasing their profitability while ensuring consumers have access to fresh, high-quality agricultural products.

Key Features:

1. User Registration and Authentication: Farmers and consumers can register for accounts securely and authenticate their identities using Spring Security. User authentication ensures data privacy and security within the platform.
2. Product Listing and Catalog: Farmers can list their available agricultural products along with detailed information such as product type, quantity, price, and location. Consumers can browse the product catalog and place orders directly with the farmers.
3. Geolocation Integration: The application integrates with geolocation services to enable consumers to search for nearby farmers and agricultural products. Geolocation data helps consumers identify local farmers and reduces transportation costs and carbon footprint.
4. Order Management: Farmers receive orders directly from consumers through the platform and can manage order fulfillment, packaging, and delivery logistics. Real-time order tracking allows farmers and consumers to monitor the status of orders throughout the supply chain.
5. Rating and Review System: Consumers can provide feedback and ratings for farmers and their products based on their experience. The rating and review system helps maintain transparency and trust within the platform, enabling consumers to make informed purchasing decisions.
6. Payment Integration: Farm2Home integrates with payment gateways to facilitate secure online payments for agricultural products. Farmers receive payments directly into their accounts, reducing dependency on cash transactions and improving financial transparency.
7. Communication Tools: The platform provides communication tools such as messaging and notifications to facilitate direct communication between farmers and consumers. Farmers can communicate order details, delivery schedules, and product updates with consumers in real-time.
8. Responsive Design: Farm2Home features a responsive design implemented with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, ensuring optimal user experience across desktop and mobile devices. Farmers and consumers can access the platform from any location with internet connectivity, facilitating flexibility and accessibility.
9. Unit Testing: JUnit testing is implemented to validate the functionality and reliability of critical components within the application, including user authentication, order management, and payment processing.
10. MVC Architecture: The application architecture follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, separating the presentation layer, business logic, and data access components. This architectural design promotes modularity, maintainability, and scalability.
